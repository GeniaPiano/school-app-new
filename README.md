This a fullstack application, powered by a NODE.JS backend and EXPRESS.JS to handle routing and create RESTfull API. It is integrated with SQL DATABASE as well as GRAPHQL for fetching data from Dato CMS. The frontend is built in React and Chakra UI has been used for styling.TYPESCRIPT is used both in the frontend and backend.

My Contribution:
Designed the application.
Implemented the backend and frontend.
Set up a SQL database.
Implemented user registration and authentication.
Deployed the application on linux server.

How to run the applicaton:

- clone the repository to your computer with command:
 `git clone https://github.com/GeniaPiano/school-app-new.git`
 - go to folder of cloned repository:
  `cd school-app-new`

Setting Up the Database:
1. Open your preferred SQL management tool such as phpMyAdmin or HeidiSQL.
2. Open the SQL script file create-database.sql in a text editor. It is located in folder sql, that you wil find in the main catalogue of repository.
3. Copy the contents of the create-sqldab.sql script.
4. In your SQL management tool, navigate to the SQL editor or query window.
5. Paste the copied script into the SQL editor.
6. Execute the script to create the database and its tables.
7. By following these steps, you will set up the database by running the SQL script in your chosen SQL management tool.
